> tell me a joke
eom
Sure, here's a joke for you:
Why did the tomato turn red?
Because it saw the salad dressing!

> turn it into a haiku
eom
Tomato turns red,
Dressing seen and it blushes,
Salad now complete.

> what did we just talk about?
eom
You asked me to tell you a joke, and I shared a tomato joke with you. You then asked me to turn the joke into a haiku, which I did.
